## about

Mostly because [bots.gg], and I'm sure that there have been many solutions to
this issue already. But this is yet another solution because I can't find those
solutions. (is this like how we now have 50 progress bar libraries on pypi?)

## usage

- modify config. get tokens, etc.
- to run:
  ```sh
  npm start # for when you just want to run it locally
  npm run forever # deploy-ish behavior
  ```
